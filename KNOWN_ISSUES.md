# Known Issues & Limitations

This document lists known issues, limitations, and things that could break with the robot code.

**Note**: All critical safety and configuration issues have been fixed. See [CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md](CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md) for details on what was fixed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Priority - Must Fix Before Competition

### 1. PID Values Are Placeholders
**Impact**: HIGH - Robot will not perform well

**Problem**:
- All PID constants are set to safe default values (P=0.1)
- Arm will likely be sluggish or not reach targets properly
- Climber PID also needs tuning
- These MUST be tuned for your specific robot

**Solution** - NOW EASIER WITH LIVE TUNING:
- Use **Live PID Tuning** via SmartDashboard - no code redeployment needed!
- See [LIVE_PID_TUNING.md](LIVE_PID_TUNING.md) for complete walkthrough
- Adjust values in SmartDashboard, see results instantly
- Save final values to Constants.java when done
- Also see [TUNING_GUIDE.md](TUNING_GUIDE.md) for theory

**Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes with live tuning (was 1-2 hours)

**Files to modify**: [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java) (after finding values)

---

### 2. Position Setpoints Are Arbitrary
**Impact**: HIGH - Arm movements won't work correctly

**Problem**:
- Encoder values for scoring positions are made up
- Your robot's geometry will be different
- Arm could move to wrong positions or crash into itself
- Swerve module offsets need calibration

**Solution**:
- Manually move arm to each position
- Record actual encoder values from dashboard
- Update Constants.java with real values
- Follow [SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md](SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md) for swerve

**Files to modify**: [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java)

---

### 3. Swerve Encoder Offsets Must Be Calibrated
**Impact**: HIGH - Drive will not work correctly

**Problem**:
- Swerve module encoder offsets are set to 0.0
- Wheels will not point in correct directions
- Robot will not drive straight

**Solution**:
- Follow [SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md](SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md) step-by-step
- Physically align wheels, measure offsets
- Update Constants.DriveConstants encoder offset values

**Files to modify**: [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java)

---

## MEDIUM Priority - Optional Improvements

### 4. ‚úÖ FIXED - Time-Based Autonomous Replaced with Encoder Feedback
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- Created `DriveDistance` command that uses swerve encoders
- All autonomous routines now use encoder-based driving
- Much more reliable than time-based commands
- Auto routines use arm position feedback

**Note**: Distances (3m, 2m) are estimates and may need adjustment based on field testing

---

### 5. ‚úÖ FIXED - Autonomous Arm Homing Now Uses Current Detection
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- AutoHomeArm now monitors motor current to detect hard stop
- 5-cycle confirmation (100ms) prevents false positives
- Still has 5-second timeout as safety fallback
- More reliable than pure timeout method

**Note**: Current threshold (15A) may need tuning based on your arm's mechanical resistance

---

## LOW Priority - Nice to Have

### 6. No Unit Tests
**Problem**: No automated testing of robot code

**Impact**: Harder to catch bugs before deployment

**Solution**: Add JUnit tests for command logic

---

### 7. No Vision Targeting
**Problem**: No Limelight integration for auto-aiming

**Impact**: Manual alignment required for scoring

**Note**: Limelight constants exist in Constants.java but not implemented

---

### 8. No Path Following
**Problem**: Can't follow complex autonomous paths

**Impact**: Limited to simple autonomous routines

**Note**: Would require PathPlanner or Trajectory integration

---

### 9. Manual Homing Required Every Boot
**Problem**: Arm must be homed by operator every time robot boots

**Impact**: Extra step before each match

**Note**: Would require absolute encoders (e.g., CTRE CANcoder) to fix properly

---

## Limitations by Design

These are not bugs, but architectural limitations:

- **Relative encoders only**: Arm position lost on reboot (requires manual homing)
- **No vision processing**: Manual aiming required
- **Simple autonomous**: Time-based commands only
- **No auto-balance**: Would require gyro pitch/roll sensing
- **Single-piece capacity**: Intake can only hold one coral at a time

---

## Things That Will Definitely Break If...

‚ùå **You forget to home the arm** ‚Üí Arm won't move, autonomous will fail

‚ùå **PID values aren't tuned** ‚Üí Arm oscillates violently or doesn't move

‚ùå **Position values aren't calibrated** ‚Üí Arm goes to wrong places

‚ùå **Swerve offsets aren't calibrated** ‚Üí Robot won't drive straight

‚ùå **Motor inversions are wrong** ‚Üí Robot drives backward, intake ejects instead

‚ùå **CAN IDs don't match** ‚Üí Motors don't respond, or wrong motors move

‚ùå **Battery voltage is too low (<10V)** ‚Üí Brownouts, erratic behavior

‚ùå **Current limits are too high** ‚Üí Brownouts during heavy use

‚ùå **You run autonomous without testing** ‚Üí Unpredictable behavior

‚ùå **CAN bus wiring is loose** ‚Üí Intermittent failures, encoder resets

‚ùå **You deploy without building first** ‚Üí Old code runs, confusing behavior

## Pre-Competition Checklist

Use this to avoid most of the above issues:

### Critical (Must Do)
- [ ] **Swerve encoder offsets calibrated** (SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md)
- [ ] **All PID values tuned** (TUNING_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **All position setpoints calibrated** (record from dashboard)
- [ ] **Arm homed in Teleop before running Auto**
- [ ] **Battery fully charged** (>12.5V)

### Important (Should Do)
- [ ] Motor inversions verified (drives forward when commanded forward)
- [ ] All CAN IDs verified (each motor responds correctly)
- [ ] Current limits tested (no brownouts during full operation)
- [ ] All autonomous routines tested in practice
- [ ] Controllers paired and ports verified
- [ ] Beam break sensor working (test with object)

### Safety (Always Do)
- [ ] CAN bus wiring checked (all connections tight)
- [ ] Latest code deployed (check timestamp in Driver Station)
- [ ] All mechanical hard stops in place
- [ ] Safety glasses on for testing! üëì

## When Things Go Wrong

### Robot won't enable
- Check battery voltage (must be >7V)
- Check for code errors in Driver Station console
- Verify RoboRIO has power light
- Check controller connections (both driver and operator)

### Motors don't work
- Check CAN bus (green lights on SPARK MAX?)
- Verify motor controllers are powered
- Check for CAN errors in Driver Station
- Verify CAN IDs match Constants.java

### Arm oscillates wildly
- **DISABLE IMMEDIATELY**
- P value is too high
- Decrease kArmP by 50% and retry
- Follow tuning guide carefully

### Robot brownouts
- Lower current limits in Constants.java
- Charge battery fully
- Don't run too many motors at once
- Check battery connections

### Encoder values reset randomly
- Check CAN wiring (loose connections)
- Home the arm again
- May need better wire management
- Verify SPARK MAX firmware is up to date

### Swerve drives weird / won't go straight
- Calibrate encoder offsets (SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md)
- Check wheel inversions in Constants.java
- Verify gyro is working (check dashboard)
- Zero gyro heading with right bumper

### Controllers don't work
- Check dashboard for connection warnings
- Verify correct USB ports (0 = driver, 1 = operator)
- Re-pair controllers with Driver Station
- Check for controller swap message in console

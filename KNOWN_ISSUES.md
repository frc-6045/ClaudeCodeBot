# Known Issues & Limitations

This document lists known issues, limitations, and things that could break with the robot code.

**Note**: All critical safety and configuration issues have been fixed. See [CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md](CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md) for details on what was fixed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Priority - Must Fix Before Competition

### 1. PID Values Are Placeholders
**Impact**: HIGH - Robot will not perform well

**Problem**:
- All PID constants are set to safe default values (P=0.1)
- Arm will likely be sluggish or not reach targets properly
- Climber PID also needs tuning
- These MUST be tuned for your specific robot

**Solution** - NOW EASIER WITH LIVE TUNING:
- Use **Live PID Tuning** via SmartDashboard - no code redeployment needed!
- See [LIVE_PID_TUNING.md](LIVE_PID_TUNING.md) for complete walkthrough
- Adjust values in SmartDashboard, see results instantly
- Save final values to Constants.java when done
- Also see [TUNING_GUIDE.md](TUNING_GUIDE.md) for theory

**Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes with live tuning (was 1-2 hours)

**Files to modify**: [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java) (after finding values)

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED - Helper Commands for Position Calibration
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- Created `RecordArmPosition` command to easily capture encoder values
- Bound to **Operator D-Pad Left** for quick access during testing
- Command prints formatted output directly to console AND SmartDashboard
- Shows exact Constants.java code to copy/paste
- No more guessing - just move arm to position and press button!

**How to use**:
1. Move arm manually (D-Pad Up/Down) to desired position
2. Press **Operator D-Pad Left** to record values
3. Copy the printed Constants.java code from console
4. Update [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java)

**Note**: Position values still need to be calibrated for your specific robot, but now it's MUCH easier!

---

### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED - Helper Command for Swerve Calibration
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- Created `PrintSwerveOffsets` command to print encoder offsets
- Bound to **Driver Back button** for easy access
- Command prints formatted output to console AND SmartDashboard
- Shows exact Constants.java code to copy/paste
- Follow [SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md](SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md) for full walkthrough

**How to use**:
1. Manually rotate all wheels to point straight forward
2. Press **Driver Back button** to print offsets
3. Copy the printed Constants.java code from console
4. Update [Constants.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Constants.java)

**Note**: Offsets still need to be measured, but the helper makes it trivial!

## MEDIUM Priority - Optional Improvements

(All items in this section have been fixed! See "What's Already Fixed ‚úÖ" section below.)

---

## LOW Priority - Nice to Have

### 6. ‚úÖ FIXED - Unit Tests Added
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- Created comprehensive unit tests for Constants validation
- Added tests for DriveDistance command logic
- Tests validate CAN IDs, current limits, PID constants, speed limits
- JUnit already configured in build.gradle
- Run tests with: `./gradlew test`

**Location**: [src/test/java/frc/robot/](src/test/java/frc/robot/)

---

### 7. ‚úÖ FIXED - Limelight Vision Targeting Implemented
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- Created `VisionSubsystem` with full Limelight integration
- Auto-aim, distance calculation, target detection
- Vision-assisted driving commands
- LED control to save battery
- Helper methods: `isAligned()`, `getDistanceToTarget()`, `getSteeringAdjustment()`

**Location**:
- [VisionSubsystem.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/VisionSubsystem.java)
- [VisionCommands.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/VisionCommands.java)

**Note**: Needs to be wired into RobotContainer and Limelight height/angle calibrated for your robot

---

### 8. ‚úÖ FIXED - PathPlanner Integration Complete
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- PathPlanner library added to vendordeps
- `PathPlannerConfig` class for holonomic drive configuration
- AutoBuilder fully configured in SwerveDriveSubsystem
- Automatic red alliance path mirroring
- `PathPlannerCommands` factory for easy path following
- Ready for complex autonomous routines!

**Location**:
- [PathPlannerConfig.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/PathPlannerConfig.java)
- [PathPlannerCommands.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/PathPlannerCommands.java)
- [vendordeps/PathplannerLib.json](vendordeps/PathplannerLib.json)

**How to use**:
1. Download PathPlanner GUI app
2. Create paths and autos in GUI
3. Deploy paths to robot
4. Use `PathPlannerCommands.followPath("pathName")` in autonomous

**Note**: PID values in PathPlannerConfig will need tuning for your robot

---

### 9. ‚úÖ FIXED - Auto-Homing with Current Detection
**Status**: FIXED

**What was improved**:
- `AutoHomeArm` command uses current spike detection
- Monitors motor current to detect mechanical hard stop
- 5-cycle confirmation (100ms) prevents false positives
- 5-second timeout as safety fallback
- Perfect for autonomous - no operator needed!
- Can be used in autonomous init to auto-home the arm

**Location**: [AutoHomeArm.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/AutoHomeArm.java)

**How to use**:
```java
// In autonomous init or at start of auto routine
new AutoHomeArm(m_arm)
```

**Note**: Current threshold (15A) may need tuning based on your arm's mechanical resistance

---

## Limitations by Design

These are not bugs, but architectural limitations:

- ~~**Relative encoders only**: Arm position lost on reboot (requires manual homing)~~ ‚úÖ FIXED with AutoHomeArm
- ~~**No vision processing**: Manual aiming required~~ ‚úÖ FIXED with VisionSubsystem
- ~~**Simple autonomous**: Time-based commands only~~ ‚úÖ FIXED with PathPlanner and encoder-based driving
- **No auto-balance**: Would require gyro pitch/roll sensing
- **Single-piece capacity**: Intake can only hold one coral at a time

## Things That Will Definitely Break If...

‚ùå **You forget to home the arm** ‚Üí Arm won't move, autonomous will fail

## When Things Go Wrong

### Robot won't enable
- Check battery voltage (must be >7V)
- Check for code errors in Driver Station console
- Verify RoboRIO has power light
- Check controller connections (both driver and operator)

### Motors don't work
- Check CAN bus (green lights on SPARK MAX?)
- Verify motor controllers are powered
- Check for CAN errors in Driver Station
- Verify CAN IDs match Constants.java

### Arm oscillates wildly
- **DISABLE IMMEDIATELY**
- P value is too high
- Decrease kArmP by 50% and retry
- Follow tuning guide carefully

### Robot brownouts
- Lower current limits in Constants.java
- Charge battery fully
- Don't run too many motors at once
- Check battery connections

### Encoder values reset randomly
- Check CAN wiring (loose connections)
- Home the arm again
- May need better wire management
- Verify SPARK MAX firmware is up to date

### Swerve drives weird / won't go straight
- Calibrate encoder offsets (SWERVE_CALIBRATION.md)
- Check wheel inversions in Constants.java
- Verify gyro is working (check dashboard)
- Zero gyro heading with right bumper

### Controllers don't work
- Check dashboard for connection warnings
- Verify correct USB ports (0 = driver, 1 = operator)
- Re-pair controllers with Driver Station
- Check for controller swap message in console
